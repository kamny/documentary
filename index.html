    <div id="bio"><h1 class="h1" id="ref1">WHO IS KIM JUNG GI?</h1>
        <p class="biotext">Kim Jung Gi is a South Korean artist who was born in the town of Goyang-Si in the province of Kyongki-Do in 1975. At the age of 19, this aspiring artist enrolled in a Fine Arts School to study Art and Design. Kim's most remarkable creative ability is his long-term memory, which he has honed over the years. His way to generate near-perfect renditions of incredibly complex situations from memory, without using references, has pushed the limits of what many artists thought was attainable.</p>

<div id="text1"> <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;"> AESOP ROCK:</i>  I know that you first had an interest in wanting to pursue comic art in kindergarten. What were some of the very first comics that pulled you into that world? 
    <br><br>
    <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">KIM JUNG GI:</i> I can’t recall all the names of the comic books that influenced me, but when I was in middle school, there were lots of pirated comic books that I came across, like Akira, Dragon Ball, City Hunter, Fist of the North Star, Apple Seed . 
    <br><br>
    <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">AESOP ROCK:</i> What objects give you the most trouble? Can you think of anything that you would have trouble putting to paper without a reference?
    <br><br>
    <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">KIM JUNG GI:</i> I think that I can draw just about anything without any restrictions. Surprisingly, I sometimes have difficulty in drawing simple things without reference, like a pinwheel, or a paper airplane.
    <br><br>
    <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">AESOP ROCK:</i> For these large-scale drawings, are you making the narrative up as you go along, or is there a plan from the beginning?
    <br><br>
    <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">KIM JUNG GI:</i> Because it is large, I cannot always have the result in my head. Usually I have 60% of the final image in my head, how it’s going to spread out. The rest, I follow my instinct; I make it up on the way.

        <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">AESOP ROCK:</i> When did you start to employ the fisheye view that is apparent in most of your work?
        <br><br>
        <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">KIM JUNG GI:</i> Since I was a kid, I always wanted to show the most when I was drawing. For example, when I draw a scene in front of me on a piece of paper, I would tend to put everything, literally everything, that enters my eyes. I think the fisheye view came naturally after always drawing like this, a technique that enables me to draw everything that I see, where I can express more in my drawings.
        <br><br>
        <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">AESOP ROCK:</i> Is most of your work completed in one sitting? Are you interested in more long-term projects that could require weeks or months to complete?
        <br><br>
        <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">KIM JUNG GI:</i> I have lots of work that is completed in one sitting, usually it is that way. But the large-scale drawings that I mostly do now, it takes two to three days in total. When I did a comic years ago, I worked on it for two whole years. For the works where I collaborated on movie projects, it took several months.
        <br><br>
        <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">AESOP ROCK:</i>   With drawing being so much in the forefront of your identity, was there ever a time you saw yourself pursuing something else entirely?
        <br><br>
        <i style="text-decoration: yellow underline;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">KIM JUNG GI:</i>  I rarely thought of another occupation. I never found myself good at something other than drawing.

        <div id="stext"><p>So, one might be asking, <strong>"What makes Kim Jung Gi so special?"</strong> As an artist, it might be easier to notice that Kim Jung Gi's understanding of human and animal anatomy, as well as his perspective knowledge allow him to produce exceptional drawings. However, it goes beyond a simple understanding. What really is the driving force behind his work is years and years of commitment to his craft. In one of his interviews, the artist talked about spending an hour a day looking at reference materials and analyzing each of them. He stresses the importance of understanding the subject matter before drawing, and it is one thing that led him to developing such a strong visual memory. </p>
